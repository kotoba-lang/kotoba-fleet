  "Signed governor decisions: the shape, the sign-off rule, and the published
  ledger.

  Three things that were about to be written three times share one namespace
  because they share one object. A receipt is signed once (`sign`), can be
  required to carry a human approval before it may materialize (`needs-signoff?`
  / `approved?`), and is published so anyone can check it later
  (`append-to-ledger!`). Splitting those across scripts is how the signed thing
  and the published thing drift apart.

  Everything except `append-to-ledger!` is pure, so the rules are testable
  without a network, a key, or a fleet.

  The ledger is append-only ON PURPOSE. The 2026-07-25 policy that documents
  show latest state (ADR-2607257000) explicitly keeps append-only for signed
  event streams — a receipt records that a decision happened at a point in
  time, and rewriting it destroys exactly the thing a signature is for."
