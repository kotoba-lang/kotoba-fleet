  "Did the agent actually do the task? — decided from the patch, not by asking
  a model.

  Everything the fleet knew so far was that ONE ~10-line task passes. That is
  not a capability measurement, and the obvious way to get one — have an LLM
  judge the output — measures the judge. So a benchmark task carries an
  `:expect` map of mechanical conditions over the diff, and this namespace is
  pure: same patch, same verdict, every time, no network and no model.

  A run is scored on two independent axes, because they fail differently:
  - **accepted** — the fleet's own gate took it (patch applies to the pin,
    tests green on the node, no protected path). This is what the fleet
    already enforces.
  - **meets-spec** — the patch did what the TASK asked. A patch can be
    accepted and still be wrong work: deleting the requirement and leaving the
    suite green passes the gate and fails here."
