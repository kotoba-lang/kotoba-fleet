  "Which machine can actually run this work-unit.

  The dispatcher used to take `:node` from the work-unit and hope. That
  assumption broke twice in one afternoon: `asher` stopped answering ssh
  mid-session, and only one node in the mesh has a JVM at all
  (ADR-2607178000 measured 1 of 9). A work-unit should say what it NEEDS —
  nbb, a JVM, a containing exec backing — and the fleet should pick a machine
  that has it, or say plainly that none does.

  A capability is measured, never configured: the probe runs on the node and
  reports what it found. `:contains-exec` is the strongest of them, because it
  runs the sandbox agent's own containment probe there — a node that cannot
  contain agent-authored code is not eligible for agent work, however much
  toolchain it has."
