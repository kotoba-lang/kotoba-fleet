  "Kotoba Capability Machine (KCM) contract.

  A KCM is not a small general-purpose VM.  It is a content-addressed Kotoba
  definition closure plus an explicit HostCaps policy.  The guest never gets a
  shell or a process-spawn tool.  Host execution is limited to declared
  `kotoba` argv vectors, invoked without a shell by the sandbox host.

  This namespace owns only the deterministic contract and identities.  The
  outer OS backing (Seatbelt today, a container/microVM for higher-risk work)
  remains fleet.sandbox-agent's responsibility."
