(ns fleet.filestore
  "File-backed append-only :db-api store (nbb host).

  `kotoba.fleet.store/mem-store` is process-local, so two agent processes on two
  machines cannot see each other's leases. This host implements the SAME
  `:db-api` contract on a single append-only file — one `pr-str`'d [e a v t]
  datom per line — so `kotoba.fleet.lease` / `governor` / `agent` / `view` run
  unchanged across processes.

  The one invariant that must survive the move off an atom is the one
  `store.cljc`'s docstring is built around: **t is assigned atomically WITH the
  append**. `swap!` gave MemStore that for free; here it comes from an exclusive
  lock file (`open(path, 'wx')` — atomic create-or-fail on POSIX), held across
  read-length → append. Without it two racing processes both compute the same t
  and `lease/holder` (earliest active claim wins) hands the same exclusive lease
  to both.

  Host-owned I/O only: the coordination logic stays in the portable `.cljc`."
