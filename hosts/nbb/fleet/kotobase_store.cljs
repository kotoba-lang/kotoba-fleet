(ns fleet.kotobase-store
  "The fleet log on kotobase.net — the same append-only `:db-api` the lease /
  governor / agent code already speaks, but shared across MACHINES instead of
  living in one process (MemStore) or one filesystem (fleet.filestore).

  Auth is self-minted CACAO: the key IS the authority for the graph its own DID
  derives (`kotobase/db/<did>/<db-name>`), so a dispatcher needs no token from
  an operator and can reach nothing but its own fleet graph.

  Two live-edge facts this had to be built around, both found by running it
  (`kotobase.edge-cacao/validate-cacao` is the authority):
  - every CACAO must carry a `kotoba://can/kotobase:pin` capability, and each
    `kotoba://graph/<scope>` resource must name the ISSUER DID — a graph CID
    there is rejected with 'CACAO graph scope does not include issuer DID';
  - the edge records nonces to stop replay, so a CACAO is single-use. Each
    request therefore mints its own; a conn cannot be captured and reused.

  Residual limitation (documented, not hidden): `kotoba.fleet.kotoba-store`
  cannot make `:transact-with-t!` atomic over a remote backend — there is no
  compare-and-swap in the `:db-api` contract — so two dispatchers CAN compute
  the same ordinal. `confirmed-holder?` below is the mitigation: after
  claiming, re-read the log and check the deterministic winner is still you
  before doing any work. Ties break on `[:lease/t :lease/id]`, so every
  observer converges on the same holder even when ordinals collide."
