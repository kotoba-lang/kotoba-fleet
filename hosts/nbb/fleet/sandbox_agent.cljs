(ns fleet.sandbox-agent
  "Sandboxed coding-agent turn — runs ON a murakumo fleet node, never on the
  operator's machine (ADR-2606302000 F3 seam: `run` for kotoba.fleet.agent).

  Contract with the dispatcher: read one EDN spec, produce ONE patch, print it
  as EDN between sentinels. It is deliberately self-contained (node builtins +
  cljs.reader only) because it is scp'd to the node and run standalone.

  Sandbox invariants — all enforced here, not asked of the model:
  1. Work happens in an ephemeral `<root>/work` extracted from a tarball of an
     EXACT pinned commit fetched by the dispatcher from the GitHub API. The
     node never sees, and cannot reach, the operator's checkouts.
  2. Every tool path is resolved and confined under `<root>/work`; `..`,
     absolute paths and symlink escapes are rejected before any I/O.
  3. The only command the agent can run is the spec's `:test-cmd` — but the
     agent can WRITE the code that command executes, so confining the file API
     is not enough on its own. `:test-cmd` therefore runs under an OS-level
     exec backing (macOS Seatbelt or Linux bubblewrap) that denies all network
     access, denies reads of the node's real home (ssh keys, tokens, tailnet
     state), and permits writes only inside the ephemeral sandbox. The backing
     is PROVED at startup by trying those escapes and refusing to run the
     session if any succeeds — a missing or broken profile fails closed, never
     silently downgrades to unsandboxed execution.
  4. The throwaway `git init` inside the sandbox exists ONLY to compute the
     patch (`git diff --binary`). No remote is ever configured, so no push /
     fetch / credential path exists from here.
  5. Budgets (turns, tool calls, wall clock, tokens) are enforced by the loop,
     never trusted to the model, and a blown budget is reported, not hidden.

  The agent CANNOT commit, push, or advance a pin: it emits a patch, the
  dispatcher submits it as a `:proposal/*` datom, and only the single-writer
  governor may materialize it."
