(ns fleet-tick
  "One bounded tick of the fleet: pick up to N work-units, dispatch each to an
  eligible node, and stop.

  A tick is deliberately BOUNDED and idempotent-by-lease rather than a daemon:
  every unit it touches is leased, every decision it makes is a signed receipt,
  and if it dies halfway the lease expires and the next tick picks the unit up.
  That is the durable-outer-loop shape (ADR-2606280001) — cadence belongs to
  whatever schedules the tick (launchd, a cron trigger), not to a process that
  must stay alive.

  It reuses `fleet.dispatch` rather than reimplementing the flow, and it probes
  nodes ONCE and reuses the capability set for every unit in the tick.

  Usage:
    nbb --classpath src:hosts/nbb:<libs> bin/fleet-tick.cljs \\
        --work-dir examples/work/ [--max 3] [--store kotobase] [--db-name fleet-log]
