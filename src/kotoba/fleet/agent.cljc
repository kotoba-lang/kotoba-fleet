(ns kotoba.fleet.agent
  "Agent-side claim loop — the other half of the fleet from the governor.

  A coding agent (kotoba-code in production) uses this to: pull an OPEN work-unit,
  optimistically lease it, run the injected `run` fn (its actual coding work), and
  submit the result as a `:proposal/*` for the governor to materialize. It never
  writes to git and never takes a lock: if it loses the lease race it just backs
  off. The `run` fn is the injection seam — a mock in tests, a kotoba-code session
  in production. The lease is HELD through the proposal so no other agent touches
  the same unit while the governor decides; it is released after a no-op or once a
  receipt lands (see `complete!`)."
