;; run-fleet-tick.cljs — one bounded tick of the kotoba-fleet coding agent.
;;
;; The tick itself is `kotoba-fleet/bin/fleet-tick.cljs`; this launcher only
;; supplies the things a scheduler cannot infer — repo root, classpath, and the
;; standing policy for unattended runs — so the scheduled path and a hand-run
;; `bin/fleet-tick.cljs` stay the same code (ADR-2607252600).
;;
;; Standing policy for UNATTENDED runs, deliberately conservative:
;;   --materialize dry-run   the tick never pushes and never opens a PR on its
;;                           own. An accepted patch lands as commits in a local
;;                           scratch repo for a human to look at. Pushing is one
;;                           flag away (FLEET_TICK_MATERIALIZE=push) and needs a
;;                           work-unit that opted in with :allow-push plus an
;;                           explicit FLEET_PUSH_TOKEN — a scheduled job should
;;                           not quietly acquire write access to repositories.
;;   --store file            the shared kotobase log needs the kagi vault, which
;;                           needs an unlocked keychain; a scheduler may not have
;;                           one. Set FLEET_TICK_STORE=kotobase once that is
;;                           established for the agent user.
;;   --max 1                 one work-unit per tick. The queue drains steadily
;;                           instead of a single tick occupying the fleet.
;;
;; The queue is ~/.gftd/fleet-queue/*.edn — the same work-unit shape
;; bin/fleet-sandbox-dispatch.cljs takes. An empty queue makes this a no-op, so
;; installing the timer costs nothing until work is put in it.
